## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in `@thisismissem/adonisjs-respond-with` (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), you can:

- open a [GitHub security issue on the project repository](https://github.com/thisismissem/adonisjs-respond-with/security/advisories/new)

You should _not_ report such issues in public GitHub issues or in other public spaces to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing projects using this package to increased risk.
